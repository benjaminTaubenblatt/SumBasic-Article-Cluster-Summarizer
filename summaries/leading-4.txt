The tobacco company stopped short of promising to take Vuse,
which comes in berry and other flavors, out of retail stores,
but Mr. Shannon said the company would enforce contractual
penalties for retailers that sell tobacco products to youths. WASHINGTON — Facing mounting government pressure and a public
backlash over an epidemic of teenage vaping, Juul Labs
announced on Tuesday that it would suspend sales of most of its
flavored e-cigarette pods in retail stores and would
discontinue its social media promotions. The company’s sleek device (nicknamed the iPhone of
e-cigarettes) resembles a flash drive and comes with flavor
pods like crème and mango, leading public health officials to
criticize the company and others for appearing to market
directly to teenagers, who are especially vulnerable to
nicotine addiction.
