Separately, the FDA plans to announce next week new
restrictions on the sales of flavored cartridge-based
e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations, allowing
them to be sold only in vape and tobacco shops that tend to
enforce age restrictions better, according to senior FDA
officials, who asked not to be named because the proposal is
not yet public. E-cigarette manufacturer Juul will stop selling fruity flavors
like mango and cucumber from brick-and-mortar stores in
response to the Food and Drug Administration's request to
curb "epidemic" levels of teen vaping, according to a person
briefed on the company's plan.
