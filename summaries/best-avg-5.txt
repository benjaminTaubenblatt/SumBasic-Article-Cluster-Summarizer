His jazzy 2013
mixtape, Faces, opens with the rapper pondering his own death:
“I shoulda died already, shit/Yeah, I shoulda died already/Came
in, I was high already.” On “God Speed,” one of the most
revealing tracks on his 2015 major-label debut, GO:OD AM, which
he released after signing a label deal with Warner Bros. worth
a reported $10 million, Miller raps, “White lines be numbing
them dark times/Them pills that I’m popping, I need to man
up/Admit it’s a problem/I need a wake-up/Before one morning I
don’t wake up.”

For Miller, music was a form of connection — to different
people, sounds and, often, himself.
