The signatories — including two former US ambassadors to Yemen,
leading legal scholars, top Saudi Arabia experts, a Nobel Peace
Laureate, a former key aide for Secretary of State Colin
Powell, and MIT linguist Noam Chomsky — want McConnell and
other senators to support a bill that could forever remove US
troops from the Yemen war, which will likely be put to a vote
on Wednesday. The bipartisan bill invokes the War Powers Resolution of
1973 (WPR), which states that if US troops are involved in
“hostilities” abroad “without a declaration of war or specific
statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the
President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.”

“Successive administrations have basically defined the word
‘hostilities’ out of existence, and so Sen. Sanders believes
it’s important that Congress reasserts itself and engages in a
more open and robust debate about where, when, and how our
nation fights in war,” a Sanders aide told me.
