But that contradicts a Monday statement from CBP
Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, who said four of his agents were
struck by rocks “but were wearing protective gear and did not
suffer serious injuries.”

Trump also questioned why a parent would run into an area
filling with tear gas, saying without evidence that some adults
grabbed unrelated children “because they think they will have a
certain status by having a child.”

Soon after, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said
in a statement that “the accepted use of nonlethal force
(also used by the Obama Administration in 2013) prevented
further injury to agents and a mass illegal rush across the
border.” The statement never mentioned tear gas.
