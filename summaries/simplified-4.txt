Separately, the FDA plans to announce next week new
restrictions on the sales of flavored cartridge-based
e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations, allowing
them to be sold only in vape and tobacco shops that tend to
enforce age restrictions better, according to senior FDA

not yet public. The tobacco company stopped short of promising to take Vuse,
which comes in berry and other flavors, out of retail stores,
but Mr. Shannon said the company would enforce contractual
penalties for retailers that sell tobacco products to youths.
